This repo was created during the livecoding workshops @[GopherCon Russia](https://www.gophercon-russia.ru/en)
(March/August 2020).

The application demonstrates how to start with observability in Go
(logging, metrics, tracing).

You can find the slides and workshop materials [here]( http://bit.ly/observab).
